LaTeX final report:  [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn)

Show the overleaf page and template in the class.

Otherwise keep this lightweight, and don't spend too much time on it. Having the page in this level in the hierarchy is good too.&#x20;

Show the amazing tablegenerator: [https://www.tablesgenerator.com/#google\_vignette](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/#google\_vignette)&#x20;

Also mention how many references to include in the report, and how to do this with mendeley and bib: sharing with a group and listing papers within mendeley.&#x20;

See below for a zip file containing the IEEE 4 page conference paper template for the report. This could be readily imported into overleaf, or, run using a local LaTeX installation (do this at your own risk):
