# LaTeX

**LaTeX** (pronounced “LAY-tek” or “LAH-tek”) is a tool for creating professional-looking documents. Unlike programs like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer, where you type and style text directly on the page, LaTeX works differently. You write your document as a plain text file with special commands to format it. Read more about typesetting here:  [https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn\_LaTeX\_in\_30\_minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn\_LaTeX\_in\_30\_minutes)



**Templates:**

There are templates available for academic conference and journal papers, many of which are available on the Overleaf templates page. The final report template we recommend is here:  [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn)&#x20;

If you prefer to use a local installation, see below for a .zip file containing the IEEE 4 page conference paper template for the report. Please do this at your own risk, we highly recommend using Overleaf otherwise:

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/IEEE Conference Template.zip" %}

**LaTeX tips:**

If you have tables in the report, consider using this table generator: [https://www.tablesgenerator.com/#google\_vignette](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/#google\_vignette)&#x20;

We require that anything you use from other papers/resources online are appropriately cited. We recommend using a citation manager like Mendeley, which works very well with Overleaf. See [https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How\_to\_link\_your\_Overleaf\_account\_to\_Mendeley\_and\_Zotero](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How\_to\_link\_your\_Overleaf\_account\_to\_Mendeley\_and\_Zotero)

This is the easiest (if you find an easier way, let us know!) way to work with references as a group as well. Alternatively, [https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography\_management\_with\_bibtex](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography\_management\_with\_bibtex) is the traditional way, which works quite well when exported from Google Scholar.&#x20;
