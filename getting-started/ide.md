# IDE

### **PyCharm**

We recommend to use [JetBrains PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as an IDE to program in Python. The community edition is open-source and sufficient for our purposes. Follow the [instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/requirements-installation-and-launching.html) to install PyCharm.

To open the MIA Lab as project and to configure the Python interpreter do the following:

1. Launch PyCharm
2. Click Open (or File > Open)
3. In the dialog navigate to `</path/to/where/you/have/the/code>/MIALab`
4. Click OK #. MIALab is now open as PyCharm project (PyCharm created the `.idea` directory)
5. Click File > Settings... to open the settings dialog
6. Navigate to Project: MIALab > Python Interpreter #. Select the Python interpreter `</path/to/your/anaconda/installation>/envs/mialab/bin/python` (on Linux and macOS) or `<\path\to\your\anaconda\installation>\envs\mialab\python.exe` (on Windows). If the interpreter is not available in the combo box, click the gear icon and choose Add Local and navigate the the files above.
7. Confirm by clicking OK.
8. Open the `hello_world.py` (`bin` directory) in the navigator.
9. Right click in the editor > Run 'hello\_world' #. Runs the hello\_world and adds a configuration (see top right corner) to the project #. You can add configurations manually under Run > Edit Configurations...

For more help, watch the [getting started](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/documentation/) videos to get accustomed with the interface.
