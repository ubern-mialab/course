Tools

There exist various tools for registration besides the implemented code for registration:

`3D Slicer <https://www.slicer.org/>`\_: Open source software which also includes registration.

`ANTs <http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/>`\_: Advanced Normalization Tools, which come with registration algorithms.

`NiftyReg <http://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/NiftyReg>`\_: Rigid, affine and non-linear registration of medical images.

`SimpleElastix <https://simpleelastix.github.io/>`\_: An extension of SimpleITK.
