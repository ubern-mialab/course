# Post-processing

Can we leverage the segmentation performance by post-processing?

* Morphological operators
* Dense conditional random field (CRF)
* Manual user interaction (e.g., brushing)

Materials

* `mialab.filtering.postprocessing`, e.g. use `DenseCRF`

### Evaluation

Which metrics are suitable for our task? What is the influence of the validation procedure on the results?

* Metric types
* Influence of e.g. small structures
* Influence of validation procedure
