# Feature Extraction

What features could be used to improve our model?

* Investigate other features
  * Hemisphere feature
  * Filter banks
  * Histogram of oriented gradients (HOGs)
* 2-D / 3-D differences

Materials

`scikit-image feature module <http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.feature.html>`\_

### Feature Selection

Can we reduce the number of features to decrease the model complexity and the computational burden.

* Decision forest feature importance
* Principal component analysis (PCA)
* Mutual information based feature selection

Materials
