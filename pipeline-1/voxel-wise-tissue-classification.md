# Voxel-wise tissue Classification

TODO: also list project ideas in this component.

Do other machine learning algorithms perform better on our task? Can we improve the segmentation performance by parameter tuning?

* Overfitting
* Parameter tuning (tree depth, forest size)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Variants of decision forests (e.g., gradient boosted trees)

### Deep Learning

Deep learning has gained much attention in the last years outperforming methods such as decision forests. What is the performance of a deep learning method on our task?
