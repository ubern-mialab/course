# MIA: Medical Image Analysis

During the MIA Lab you will work on the task of brain tissue segmentation from magnetic resonance (MR) images (see [data](topics/data.md)). We have set up an entire pipeline to solve this task, specifically:

* Pre-processing
* Registration
* Feature extraction
* Voxel-wise tissue classification
* Post-processing
* Evaluation

During the laboratory (see [schedule for more specifics](getting-started/schedule-autumn-2024.md)) you will learn and implement a complete [pipeline](broken-reference) and investigate one of the elements in-depth. You will get to know and use [various libraries and software tools](getting-started/tools/) needed in the daily life as biomedical engineer or researcher in the medical image analysis domain.

Enjoy!
