# Medical Image Analysis

During the MIA Lab you will work on the task of brain tissue segmentation from magnetic resonance (MR) images (see [data](data.md)). We have set up an entire pipeline to solve this task, specifically:

* Pre-processing
* Registration
* Feature extraction
* Voxel-wise tissue classification
* Post-processing
* Evaluation

During the laboratory you will get to know the entire pipeline and investigate one of these pipeline elements in-depth (see [pipeline](pipeline.md)). You will get to know and use various libraries and software tools needed in the daily life as biomedical engineer or researcher in the medical image analysis domain (see [tools](getting-started/tools.md)).

Enjoy!
