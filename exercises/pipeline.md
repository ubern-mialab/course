# Pipeline

### Overall Goal

Now that you have attempted the [image basics exercise](image-basics.md), this next one is meant to provide some deeper exposure to the code base and the registration pipeline.&#x20;

### Getting Started

This exercise is setup using GitHub classroom. To attempt the assignment, use the following link:

[https://classroom.github.com/a/yBHZYgEm](https://classroom.github.com/a/yBHZYgEm)

This should create a new private repository for you, which you can then clone and start working on. The process is the same as earlier - make changes to the pipeline.py script and run the tests in test\_pipeline.py. Once the tests pass locally, then commit and push your changes, thereby running the tests on the autograder.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that you'll have to change the location of the repository from \*/ubern-mialab/\* to \*/\<your-GitHub-username>/\* in the above links, once you have forked correctly.
{% endhint %}

GitHub runs it's 'actions' behind the scenes, and you'll either see a red ❌ or a green ✅ next to the commit message you entered previously.&#x20;

The goal really is to get the green ✅ every time you make a change, which will only happen when all the functions are completed correctly (correctly as defined by the tests in test\_pipeline.py). Clicking on the check mark will show more details about completion of the homework.&#x20;

Once you're done, please share a link to your fork with us on Slack, so we can confirm you've completed the assignment for the bonus grade (if such a need arises).

This is the first time we are using GitHub classroom, and so if you have any trouble, please do not hesitate to reach out to your friendly neighborhood TAs on Slack.
