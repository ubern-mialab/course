# Random Forest

#### Overall Goal <a href="#overall-goal" id="overall-goal"></a>

Now that you have attempted the [pipeline homework](pipeline.md) this next one is meant to provide some deeper exposure to the classification workflow.

#### Getting Started <a href="#getting-started" id="getting-started"></a>

This exercise is setup using GitHub classroom. To attempt the assignment, use the following link:

This should create a new private repository for you, which you can then clone and start working on. The process is a little easier than earlier - there are no auto-graded tests - you are more flexible this time to make changes to the code and then report your best accuracies and hyper-parameters in the #random channel on slack!&#x20;
